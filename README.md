### StrategyDP_Task

**Description:**  
You're developing a notification service that supports multiple types of notifications to users, such as SMS, Email, Messenger, and Slack notifications. The key challenge is to implement this with flexibility, allowing the service to send notifications through any type without altering the core logic.

```java
sendNotification(User user, String message)
