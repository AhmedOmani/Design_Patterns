### StrategyDP_Task

**Description:**  
You're developing a notification service that supports multiple types of notifications to users, such as SMS, Email, Messenger, and Slack notifications. The key challenge is to implement this with flexibility, allowing the service to send notifications through any type without altering the core logic.  

For simplicity, the main function that should be used is:

```java
sendNotification(User user, String message)
```

### TemplateMethodTask_DP

**Description:**  
You're developing video editing presets with functionality that people can leverage, but you need to support their availability so they can extend the functionality and choose whatever rendering option they want.

The video editing presets functionality should be able to support 3 kinds of video rendering quality: FHD, HD, and SD.

Video editing preset functionality includes (enhancing video quality, applying color correction based on user preferences, enhancing audio quality, applying some filters, and finally rendering the video based on user preferences.

### MementoTask_DP

**Description:**  
You're developing a drawing diagram canvas application that should be used for drawing system designs. You should provide the functionality of undo and redo during drawing on the canvas.

The undo should be able to restore the previous state, and the redo should be able to do the reverse.

The canvas should have the following attributes regarding diagrams: content, color, and border.

### VisitorDP_Task

**Description:** 

Suppose we have a document processing system where we need to perform different operations like counting words, extracting text, and analyzing formatting. Each operation needs to be applied to different types of documents, e.g (text files, spread sheets and presentation files)

Consider adding those three operations counting words, extracting text, and formattingâ€”without touching the codebase.

We have three document types (text files, spread sheets, and presentation files) that should support the new functionalities

### IteratorDP_Task 

**Description:** 

You're developing a social media application where you need to support the functionality of iterating through people's profiles, e.g., friends, family, and mutual friends.

This functionality needs to be re-used within the company team so they can iterate through different profile iterators to help them get more insights and dashboards across people's profiles.

### ChainResponsibilityDP_Task 

**Description:** 

You are developing a big data batch job that takes some sort of data as input, and there is a pipeline of operations that need to occur on this data.

The data needs to pass the whole pipeline successfully in order to proceed with handling the data.

The pipeline consists of validation checks on data, formatting checks, data size checks, and finally personal information checks.

The batch job needs to fulfill the whole pipeline of checks and pass them successfully before proceeding with processing the data.
