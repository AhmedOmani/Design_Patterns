# Design Patterns Tasks Repository

This repository contains a series of tasks that demonstrate the implementation of various design patterns. Each task is focused on solving real-world problems using a different design pattern, providing flexibility and scalability in the solutions.

### StrategyDP_Task

**Description:**  
You're developing a notification service that supports multiple types of notifications to users, such as SMS, Email, Messenger, and Slack notifications. The key challenge is to implement this with flexibility, allowing the service to send notifications through any type without altering the core logic.  

For simplicity, the main function that should be used is:

```java
sendNotification(User user, String message)
```

### TemplateMethodTask_DP

**Description:**  
You're developing video editing presets with functionality that people can leverage, but you need to support their availability so they can extend the functionality and choose whatever rendering option they want.

The video editing presets functionality should be able to support 3 kinds of video rendering quality: FHD, HD, and SD.

Video editing preset functionality includes (enhancing video quality, applying color correction based on user preferences, enhancing audio quality, applying some filters, and finally rendering the video based on user preferences.

### MementoTask_DP

**Description:**  
You're developing a drawing diagram canvas application that should be used for drawing system designs. You should provide the functionality of undo and redo during drawing on the canvas.

The undo should be able to restore the previous state, and the redo should be able to do the reverse.

The canvas should have the following attributes regarding diagrams: content, color, and border.

### VisitorDP_Task

**Description:** 

Suppose we have a document processing system where we need to perform different operations like counting words, extracting text, and analyzing formatting. Each operation needs to be applied to different types of documents, e.g (text files, spread sheets and presentation files)

Consider adding those three operations counting words, extracting text, and formattingâ€”without touching the codebase.

We have three document types (text files, spread sheets, and presentation files) that should support the new functionalities

### IteratorDP_Task 

**Description:** 

You're developing a social media application where you need to support the functionality of iterating through people's profiles, e.g., friends, family, and mutual friends.

This functionality needs to be re-used within the company team so they can iterate through different profile iterators to help them get more insights and dashboards across people's profiles.

### ChainResponsibilityDP_Task 

**Description:** 

You are developing a big data batch job that takes some sort of data as input, and there is a pipeline of operations that need to occur on this data.

The data needs to pass the whole pipeline successfully in order to proceed with handling the data.

The pipeline consists of validation checks on data, formatting checks, data size checks, and finally personal information checks.

The batch job needs to fulfill the whole pipeline of checks and pass them successfully before proceeding with processing the data.

### StateDP_Task 

**Description:**

You are developing a project management application in which you can create various tasks, and each task would have a different state. By default, tasks would be on the backlog until they were picked up by users and marked as ToDo.

Tasks would have different states, e.g., backlog, to-do, in-progress, blocked, in-review, done.

Backlog means a task is not picked by anybody.

To-Do means: The task has already been picked by someone.

In-progress means a task is already being progressed by someone.

Blocked means: The task is already paused due to some reasons.

In-review means the task is already being reviewed by someone else.

Done means the Task is already finished successfully

Considering once a task is marked as done, you cannot change its state further. Also, no tasks are marked as done unless they are reviewed.

### CommandDP_Task 

**Description:** 

You are developing a text editor which has the following functionality: Copy, cut, and delete. Each of these functions needs to be supported in many ways: e.g., Edit Menu, Keyboard Shortcuts).

Those commands also need to be saved in history so we can easily undo and redo them.

Considering having the following keyboard shortcuts for each one: (copy -> ctrl + c) , (cut -> ctrl + x) and (delete -> DEL)

**Note:**
For the point of undo & redo I implement MementoDP for this subtask m but it i didnt consider it in the UML diagram.

### MediatorDP_Task 

**Description:** 

You are developing a coordination system that allows multiple airplanes to communicate and coordinate their movements through a control tower, which helps them avoid collisions and ensure safe takeoffs and landings.

We would have two types of airplanes: commercial and travel airplanes, which support the following functionality, e.g request take off, request landing and a method to notify air traffic control.

### AdapterDP_Task 

**Description:** 

Let's consider a scenario where we have an integration with a third-party service, ReportService, to receive a report that is in CSV format, and we are using it in our client, but we aim to now add a dashboard service that needs data in JSON.

So the main client is your client, and you need to talk to the reporting service in order to get the report and pass it to the dashboard service, but the reporting service gives you uncompatible data with the dashboard.
